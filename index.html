        <h1> 1:-Cosmic Nebula </h1>
        <img src="photo1.jpg" alt="Photo1" class="full-width-image">
        <h5> This breathtaking image captures the mesmerizing beauty of a "cosmic nebula" ‚Äî a massive cloud of gas and
            dust where stars are born. Swirling hues of violet, crimson, and amber blend like celestial paint strokes
            across the universe, giving the scene an ethereal, almost dreamlike quality. At the heart of the image,
            brilliant light glows from newly forming stars, pushing through the darkness like hope in the void. Wisps of
            interstellar dust weave around the light, sculpting dramatic shapes that evoke mystery and awe. It's a
            reminder of the vastness of space and the wonders that lie far beyond our world ‚Äî a glimpse into the
            creative power of the universe itself.</h5>
        <h1> 2:-Ursa Major </h1>
        <img src="photo2.jpg" alt="Photo2" class="full-width-image">
        <h5> This image beautifully illustrates the constellation "Ursa Major", famously known as the Great Bear. With
            star lines gracefully connecting the major points, the familiar shape of the bear comes to life in the night
            sky. Next to it, Canes Venatici, the hunting dogs, is also shown ‚Äî two faithful companions chasing across
            the heavens. The artwork bridges astronomy and mythology, reminding us of ancient stargazers who turned
            patterns of stars into epic stories. Ursa Major contains the Big Dipper, one of the most easily recognizable
            star groupings in the Northern Hemisphere, used for centuries as a guide to navigate. Against the serene
            twilight backdrop and silhouette of trees, this image captures both the scientific wonder and the timeless
            beauty of stargazing.</h5>
        <h1> 3:- Pegasus constellation </h1>
        <img src="photo3.jpg" alt="Photo3" class="full-width-image">
        <h5>This image showcases the "Pegasus constellation", a majestic winged horse from Greek mythology immortalized
            in the stars. The bright square at the center, known as the Great Square of Pegasus, forms the heart of this
            constellation and is one of the most recognizable patterns in the autumn night sky. With its outstretched
            legs and wings, Pegasus appears to leap across the cosmos, symbolizing freedom, inspiration, and
            imagination. Just beneath the constellation, the planet Saturn glows faintly, adding a celestial touch of
            reality to this mythical scene. The dark, star-speckled background contrasts beautifully with the outlined
            figure, merging myth and science into a single, awe-inspiring visual.</h5>
        <h1> 4:- Draco </h1>
        <img src="photo4.jpg" alt="Photo4" class="full-width-image">
        <h5>This stunning image features the constellation "Draco", the celestial dragon that winds its way through the
            northern sky. With its long, curving body made of stars, Draco coils protectively between the Big and Little
            Dipper, guarding the night with ancient strength. In mythology, Draco is often seen as a mighty serpent or
            guardian beast ‚Äî a symbol of power, mystery, and endurance. The illustration brings the constellation to
            life, showing its dragon form with majestic claws and a fierce expression, as though it's watching over the
            stars. Set against a deep indigo sky sprinkled with distant stars, Draco's presence feels both magical and
            eternal ‚Äî a powerful reminder of the stories written across the cosmos.</h5>
        <h1> 5:- Hercules </h1>
        <img src="photo5.jpg" alt="Photo5" class="full-width-image">
        <h5>This striking image depicts the constellation "Hercules", honoring the legendary Greek hero renowned for his
            strength and bravery. Shown mid-battle, Hercules appears suspended among the stars, arms raised and muscles
            tensed as if confronting one of his famed Twelve Labors. The constellation‚Äôs star pattern forms a somewhat
            asymmetrical figure, yet when overlaid with the mythological artwork, it evokes a powerful image of
            determination and resilience. Surrounded by a sea of shimmering stars, Hercules reminds us of the ancient
            stories that cultures have passed down through generations ‚Äî tales of courage, endurance, and the triumph of
            will. This celestial tribute to a timeless hero adds another layer of magic to the ever-inspiring canvas of
            the night sky.</h5>
        <h1> 6:- Leo </h1>
        <img src="Photo6.jpg" alt="Photo6" class="full-width-image">
        <h5>This celestial image features the mighty constellation "Leo", the lion ‚Äî a timeless symbol of courage,
            power, and royalty. With its radiant stars tracing the outline of a proud lion in mid-stride, Leo dominates
            the spring night sky. The distinctive sickle shape in the head region resembles a backwards question mark,
            often representing the lion‚Äôs mane, while the body stretches gracefully across the stars. Below Leo, the
            planets Mars and Mercury shine brightly, adding a touch of planetary wonder to the scene. Leo‚Äôs legacy
            reaches back to Babylonian and Greek mythology, where it was associated with the Nemean Lion defeated by
            Hercules. This starry depiction captures not just a constellation, but a story of strength written in the
            heavens ‚Äî a powerful blend of astronomy and mythology that continues to inspire dreamers under the night
            sky.</h5>
        <h1> 7:- Rosette Nebula </h1>
        <img src="Photo7.jpg" alt="Photo7" class="full-width-image">
        <h5>This stunning cosmic masterpiece is the "Rosette Nebula", a vast and vibrant cloud of interstellar gas and
            dust located in the constellation Monoceros, the Unicorn. Its fiery red and golden petals unfurl across
            space like a celestial rose in full bloom, surrounding a brilliant blue core where new stars are being born.
            The rich colors come from energized hydrogen and oxygen atoms, glowing under the intense radiation of young,
            massive stars at the center. The nebula spans over 100 light-years, reminding us of the unimaginable scale
            and artistry of the universe. It is both a cradle of stellar life and a breathtaking symbol of cosmic beauty
            ‚Äî like the universe painting with light and fire on a galactic canvas.</h5>
        <h1> 8:-Ursa Minor </h1>
        <img src="Photo8.jpg" alt="Photo8" class="full-width-image">
        <h5>This image features the gentle constellation "Ursa Minor", also known as the Little Bear. Most famously, it
            contains Polaris, the North Star, which has guided travelers and navigators for centuries due to its fixed
            position in the night sky. The seven main stars form a smaller version of the Big Dipper, with a curved
            handle and a square bowl ‚Äî a shape both familiar and easy to spot. Mythologically, Ursa Minor is often seen
            as the bear cub of Ursa Major, forever circling the North Pole in the heavens. This constellation holds a
            quiet, steady presence, symbolizing direction, hope, and stability. Against the peaceful twilight sky in
            this image, Ursa Minor glows with soft brilliance ‚Äî a comforting reminder that even in the vastness of
            space, there are stars that never lose their way.</h5>
        <h1> 9:- Orion And Taurus </h1>
        <img src="Photo9.jpg" alt="Photo9" class="full-width-image">
        <h5>This image beautifully captures the constellations "Orion and Taurus", two of the most iconic star patterns
            in the night sky.</h5>
        <h5>Orion, the Hunter, is easily recognized by his "belt" ‚Äî a straight line of three bright stars. Known from
            mythology as a mighty warrior, Orion stands in the sky with a raised club, forever chasing the bull across
            the heavens. Just beside him is Taurus, the Bull, with its distinctive "V" shape representing its face and
            the bright star Aldebaran as its fiery red eye. The long horns and powerful posture of Taurus symbolize
            strength and resilience.</h5>
        <h5>Together, Orion and Taurus form a dynamic duo in celestial storytelling ‚Äî a hunter locked in an eternal
            pursuit of the bull. Their glowing figures shine against the black velvet of space, connecting us with
            ancient myths and the timeless beauty of the universe.</h5>

    <h3>DISCRIPTION</h3>
    <h5>The night sky has captivated human curiosity since the beginning of time. Across every culture and civilization,
        people have looked up at the stars, weaving stories and myths into the patterns they saw in the heavens. Today,
        modern astronomy recognizes 88 official constellations, each occupying a specific area of the celestial sphere.
        These constellations serve not only as visual groupings of stars but also as a celestial coordinate system,
        helping astronomers locate objects in the vast universe. Though many of the stars that form a constellation may
        be light-years apart, their arrangement from Earth creates familiar shapes that have stood the test of time,
        linking us to ancient traditions and modern science.</h5>
    <h5>Each of these 88 constellations has a unique story, often rooted in Greek, Roman, or other mythologies. For
        example, Orion, the hunter, is one of the most prominent constellations in the winter sky. It includes
        Betelgeuse, a red supergiant, and Rigel, a luminous blue-white star‚Äîboth among the brightest stars in the sky.
        Just below Orion lies Canis Major, home to Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Known as the "Dog Star,"
        Sirius has been revered in cultures from Egypt to Polynesia for its brilliance and significance in agricultural
        calendars.</h5>
    <h5>To the north, Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Great and Little Bears, contain the Big Dipper and Little Dipper
        asterisms. The tip of Ursa Minor‚Äôs tail is Polaris, the North Star, which remains nearly fixed in our sky due to
        its alignment with Earth's axis. Sailors and explorers have depended on Polaris for centuries as a reliable
        guide for navigation.</h5>
    <h5>Moving along the celestial equator, Leo the Lion boasts Regulus, a bluish-white star that forms the heart of the
        lion and serves as one of the most important stars in ancient astrology. In the east, Scorpius, representing a
        giant scorpion, is one of the most dramatic constellations, curving along the Milky Way and containing the red
        giant Antares, often referred to as the "Heart of the Scorpion."
    </h5>
    <h5>Taurus the Bull includes Aldebaran, a red giant that represents the bull‚Äôs eye. Near it lies the Pleiades
        cluster‚Äîoften mistaken for a constellation itself‚Äîshining like a miniature version of the Big Dipper. Meanwhile,
        Lyra, home to Vega, forms one corner of the Summer Triangle, a prominent formation that also includes Altair in
        Aquila and Deneb in Cygnus.
    </h5>
    <h5>Constellations like Pegasus and Andromeda stretch across the autumn sky, telling tales of Greek mythology‚Äîof
        heroes, monsters, and sacrifice. Andromeda is particularly famous because it hosts the Andromeda Galaxy, the
        nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and visible to the naked eye on clear, dark nights.</h5>
    <h5>Draco the Dragon slithers between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, winding around the northern pole. Despite its faint
        stars, its long shape and lore give it a prominent place in the sky. Hercules, another constellation from Greek
        mythology, depicts the mighty hero locked in eternal battle, and Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown, symbolizes
        a royal diadem placed among the stars.</h5>
    <h5>Beyond practical purposes, these constellations connect us to the infinite. Hydra, the largest constellation,
        spans over 100 degrees across the southern sky, while Crux, the Southern Cross, is a cultural icon in the
        southern hemisphere, appearing on flags and inspiring countless sailors. Centaurus contains Alpha Centauri, the
        closest star system to our own.</h5>
    <h5>Though the stars within each constellation differ in size, age, and distance from Earth, they together form
        visible patterns that continue to inspire wonder. Their brightest stars often serve as anchors for identifying
        constellations and are used in everything from calendar-making to navigation, storytelling, and even astrology.
    </h5>
    <h5>From Orion‚Äôs belt to Scorpius‚Äôs sting, from Leo‚Äôs roar to Draco‚Äôs twist, the constellations are more than just
        stars‚Äîthey are cosmic poems written across the night. They remind us of our place in the vastness of space and
        the stories we share as human beings. As Shreya celebrates her 16th birthday under this starlit sky, may she
        shine just like the brightest stars‚Äîbold, radiant, and full of infinite possibilities. Just like the
        constellations that have guided humanity for millennia, may her light inspire the world around her.
